# Sleep Study
Sleep is essential for maintaining both physical and mental health, influencing everything from cell repair to memory consolidation and disease prevention. In this project, I worked as a data science consultant for SleepInc, a sleep-tracking startup. Using anonymized data from their SleepScope app, I explored and analyzed patterns to uncover how lifestyle factors impact sleep quality and duration. My goal was to provide actionable insights to help SleepInc enhance its app features and support users in improving their sleep habits.

Key Deliverables:

1. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify sleep patterns.
2. Uncovered correlations between lifestyle habits and sleep quality.
3. Developed data-driven recommendations for better sleep.

This project highlights my ability to analyze real-world datasets, visualize findings, and provide meaningful insights to address practical challenges.
