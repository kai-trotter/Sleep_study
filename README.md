# Sleep_study
In this project, I worked as a data science consultant for SleepInc, a sleep-tracking startup. Using anonymized data from their SleepScope app, I analyzed how lifestyle factors impact sleep quality and duration. My work included uncovering patterns, identifying correlations, and providing actionable insights to improve sleep health.
